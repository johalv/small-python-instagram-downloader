# small-python-instagram-downloader

Simple yet, _hopefully_, powerful
---------------------

This is a very simple, **and work still in progress**, downloader for Instagram photos. It is a very "manual" way of downloading the highest resolution from a post. 


What and why?
---------------------

This is just me trying what *_BeautifulSoup_* together with *_tkinter_* and *_wget_* can accomplish.

The idea behind it is that the software simulates a keyboard command that will go to the next picture of the active picture. 

1. Start off with chosing a Instagram **post**
2. Run the program
3. Chose how many pictures you want to save
4. Go to your active Instagram tab in your browser
5. Stay in the browser not touching your keyboard
6. Done!

### Things that currently __do not__ work and need more thought:

> A "multipost" saves only the last photo
> When browsing a video, the thumbnail will be downloaded
> Sometimes the timing is off, resulting in a duplicates
